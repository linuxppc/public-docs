An overview white paper has been jointly published
by IBM, Motorola, and Apple on the development
of the PowerPC hardware reference platform.  It is
in Postscript format.  If you cannot print Postscript files,
you may call 1-800-IBM-4FAX and request document
#3559.

A new technical white paper has been added.  It is in
Postscript format.  If you cannot print Postscript files,
you may call 1-800-IBM-4FAX and request hardcopies
by its appropriate document number.

1. PowerPC Reference Platform Architectural Aspects of
   Power Management
   (pm_paper.ps: 12 pages)
   Document #3558
   This paper presents an overview of Power Management and
   defines system-level requirements for hardware and software.

Five additional technical papers are available via ftp file
transfer.  These files are in Postscript format.  If you cannot
print Postscript files, you may call 1-800-IBM-4FAX and request
hardcopies, by document number.


1. PowerPC Endian Switch Code
   (ENDIAN.PS: 58K bytes, 16 pages)
   Document# 3553
   This report summaries various considerations when performing
   endian changing after boot time for the current set of
   PowerPC processors and different bus bridges/memory controllers.

2. Plug and Play for PowerPC Reference Platform
   (PNP.PS: 59K bytes, 14 pages)
   Document# 3554
   This paper outlines the concepts of Plug and Play which
   lets computer hardware and attached devices work together
   automatically, and applies them to a PowerPC Platform.

3. PCI DMA for PowerPC Reference Platform
   (PCIDMA.PS: 51K bytes, 10 pages)
   Document# 3555
   This paper explores the various options of Direct Memory Access (DMA)
   and make recommendation for the PowerPC Reference Platform.

4. PowerPC 60x/PCI Bus Bridge Design for PowerPC Reference Platform
   (PPCIREQ.PS: 101K bytes, 20 pages)
   Document# 3556
   This paper discusses design and implementation of the 60x/PCI
   bus bridge chip for PowerPC Reference Platform design.

5. L2 Cache Design for PowerPC-Based Systems
   (L2PART1.PS: 131K bytes, pages 1-5,
    L2PART2.PS: 124Kbytes, pages 6-8,
    L2PART3.PS: 156K bytes, pages 9-12,)
    Document #3557 for all three parts
   This paper provides some guidance in designing, specifying, or
   selecting L2 cache subsystems for PowerPC-based computers targeted
   by the PowerPC Reference Platform Specification.

The PowerPC Reference Platform Specification Version 1.1 is available
via ftp file transfer.  There are 8 files to the document and are
in Postscript format.  You will need approximately 12.7MB of disk space.

SRP1_101 : Page   1- 40
SRP1_102 : Page  41- 80
SRP1_103 : Page  81-120
SRP1_104 : Page 121-160
SRP1_105 : page 161-200
SRP1_106 : page 201-240
SRP1_107 : page 241-280
SRP1_108 : page 281-319

Files with extension .ps.Z were compressed in UNIX, while
the one with extension .EXE is a self-exploding PKZIPed package.

These files are for printing and viewing.  You may not alter
them to produce your own version of the specification.  They
are copyrighted by IBM.
